## Ruby class for Alpha led matrix communication
This is a simple class I wrote to communicate with a 1990-era Betabrite led matrix. This should serve as a decent start for other led signs using the Alpha protocol.

See http://www.teksolutionsllc.com/download/alphaprotodoc.pdf for the protocol documentation.
